# heat-risk-maricopa

Problem background:

Maricopa County has experienced some of the highest heat‑related death counts in the United States, with more than 600 heat‑related deaths in 2024 alone.
​
At the same time, median household income and housing costs vary widely across the county, and some communities face higher social vulnerability based on CDC and Arizona Social Vulnerability Index measures.
​

Project goal:

This project analyzes patterns between heat exposure, income, and social vulnerability across neighborhoods in Maricopa County to highlight areas that may face higher risk during extreme heat events.
